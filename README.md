# GekkoTimeseries
Gekko Timeseries Software: Timeseries handling, and solving of large-scale economic models.

Gekko is a free time-series oriented software package for handling and analyzing timeseries data, and for solving and analyzing large-scale economic models. Since 2009, Gekko is being used by Danish ministeries, banks, interest groups and universities, for the simulation of economic and energy-related models (more). The software runs under Windows (.NET), and is open source (GNU GPL).

Some features:
* Timeseries-oriented software, with flexible databanks. Very suitable for modelling and data revision programs.
* Annual, quarters, months and undated frequencies supported, more to come. Conversions between these are in-built.
* Dynamically loaded and compiled models, including failsafe mode.
* Gauss and Newton solvers, with ordering and feedback logic. Fair-Taylor or Newton-Fair-Taylor solver for forward-looking models. Any number of simultaneous goals/means possible.
* In-built equation browser, with integrated variable list.
* Decomposition/tracking of changes in model equations.
* Lists, values, dates, strings, etc., including many functions dealing with these.
* Matrix calculations, including construction, addition, multiplication, inversion, etc. etc.
* User-defined functions.
* Strict language syntax (via in-built ANTLR parser), with loops, conditionals etc.
* Graphics by means of embedded gnuplot
* Interface to the free open-souce R package for econometrics, data mining etc.
* Seasonal correction (X12A)
* Tabelling and menu system, outputting in text, html or Excel
* Read/write from Excel or other spreadsheets. Formats like tsd, prn, csv supported.
* Used by Statistics Denmark, Ministry of Finance, Ministry for Economic Affairs, Danish Energy Agency, Technical University of Denmark, universities and more.
* Easy installation by means of a all-inclusive Windows installer, or manually by means of a zip-file with gekko.exe etc.
* Open source. No licenses to compilers etc. -- everything used is C#/.NET (+ gnuplot, 7zip and x12a). So everything is open-source, and therefore free of charge.
